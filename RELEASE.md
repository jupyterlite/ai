# Making a new release of jupyterlite_ai

The extension can be published to `PyPI` and `npm` using the [Jupyter Releaser](https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_releaser).

## Automated releases with the Jupyter Releaser

The extension repository should already be compatible with the Jupyter Releaser. But
the GitHub repository and the package managers need to be properly set up. Please
follow the instructions of the Jupyter Releaser [checklist](https://jupyter-releaser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to_guides/convert_repo_from_repo.html).

Here is a summary of the steps to cut a new release:

- Go to the Actions panel
- Run the "Step 1: Prep Release" workflow
- Check the draft changelog
- Run the "Step 2: Publish Release" workflow

> [!NOTE]
> Check out the [workflow documentation](https://jupyter-releaser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/making_release_from_repo.html)
> for more information.

## Publishing to `conda-forge`

If the package is not on conda forge yet, check the documentation to learn how to add it: https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/adding_pkgs.html

Otherwise a bot should pick up the new version publish to PyPI, and open a new PR on the feedstock repository automatically.
